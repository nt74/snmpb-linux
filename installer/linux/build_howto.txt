How to build a binary rpm for snmpb
------------------------------------

1- cd rpm
2- rpmbuild --define "_topdir $PWD" -bb SPECS/snmpb.spec

This will build the package and create a .rpm 
file in the local RPMS/i386 directory.

This will install the package by default in /usr.
Pass --define "prefix /usr/local/mycustomdir" to rpmbuild to change this.

Note: to install the package:
sudo rpm -i RPMS/*/snmpb-*.rpm

How to build a binary deb for snmpb
------------------------------------

1- cd deb/BUILD 
2- debuild --no-sign

This will build the package and create a .deb
file in the local deb/ directory.

This will install the package by default in /usr.
Change the TOP_INSTALLDIR value in the deb/BUILD/debian/rules file to change this.

Note: to install the package:
sudo dpkg -i snmpb_x.x.x_i386.deb
